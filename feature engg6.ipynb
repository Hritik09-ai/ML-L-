    "\n",
    "# ANSWER \n",
    "# The Pearson correlation coefficient, often denoted by r, is a measure of the strength and direction of a linear \n",
    "# relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1,\n",
    "# where:\n",
    "\n",
    "# r=1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship,\n",
    "# r=−1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and\n",
    "# r=0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
    "# To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam (X) \n",
    "# and their final exam scores (Y), you would follow these steps:\n",

    "# decrease.\n",
    "# If r=0, there is no linear relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "# Additionally, the magnitude of r indicates the strength of the relationship. A larger absolute value of r suggests a\n",
